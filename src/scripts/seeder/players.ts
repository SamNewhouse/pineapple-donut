 * Generate an array of test players with randomised attributes.
 *
 * Each player has:
 * - A unique UUID as their playerId
 * - A friendly random username (two English words joined by '-')
 * - A pseudo-random email for testing login/signup flows
 * - A random number of total scans (0â€“2000), for gameplay stat diversity
 * - A creation timestamp for sorting/filter tests
 *
 * @param count - How many players to generate (default: 45)
 * @returns Player[] array with fully-formed random test users
 *
 * Usage: Call in seeding scripts to quickly populate your Players table and enable
 * robust dev/test UIs, game logic, or social features.
